# Cloud-computing
Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user. In simple words cloud computing is just all about storing and accessing data and applications over the internet, rather than on your local machine or in-house servers.

## Some definitions
1. Data center: A data center is just a remote location where servers and other computing infrastructures are kept and operated.

2. Multi cloud: It is simply the use of services from multiple cloud providers. For example an organisation that decides to use services from AWS and Microsoft Azure is using multi cloud.

3. Hybrid cloud: This just a combination of on-premises services (private) cloud and the public cloud. Example an organization that uses his own servers and then linking or using it along with resources from AWS or other cloud providers.

4. Edge Computing: This type of computing involves processing data closer to its source, reducing latency and bandwidth usage.

5. Serverless Computing: In this type of computing developers just build and run their applications without managing the infrastructure. Here the managemen of the infrastructure is managed by the cloud provider.

## Good Practices and Bad Practices in cloud computing.
1. Good Practices:
- Security: When working with the cloud it is required for you to implement a strong security policy including encryption, access control, and regular audits.

- Cost Management: You can use cost management tools to monitor and optimize cloud spending.

- Scalability: When implementing a cloud infrastructure make sure your implementation handles the scaling of your applications.

- Backup and Recovery: Implement robust backup and disaster recovery plans to ensure data integrity.

2. Bad Practices:
- Ignore security
- Overprovisioning: Avoid allocating more resources for than required as this can increase cost.
- Vendor lock-in: You should not rely only on one service provider
